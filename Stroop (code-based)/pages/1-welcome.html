  <p>Welcome to the <strong>Stroop experiment</strong>!</p>
  <p>In this experiment, your task will be to <strong>identify the color of the word shown on the screen</strong>.<br>The word itself is immaterial &mdash; you can safely ignore it.</p>
  <p>To indicate the color of the word, please use the keys <strong>r</strong>, <strong>g</strong>, <strong>b</strong> and <strong>o</strong> for <span style="color: red">red</span>, <span style="color: green">green</span>, <span style="color: blue">blue</span> and <span style="color: orange">orange</span>, respectively.<br>
  Please answer quickly, and as accurately as you can.</p>
  <p>We'll start with some practice trials to get you warmed up.</p>
